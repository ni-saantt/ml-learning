30 Days of Machine Learning

This repository documents my 30-day learning journey in Machine Learning, starting from fundamental concepts and gradually moving toward practical implementation through hands-on projects.

The goal of this challenge is to build a strong foundation in Machine Learning by learning consistently and applying concepts through real datasets and notebooks.
