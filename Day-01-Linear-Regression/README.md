Day 01 – Linear Regression (House Price Prediction)

Concept-
Learned how Linear Regression works and how to train a model using
area as input to predict house prices.

Workflow :
1. Loaded dataset using Pandas.
2. Visualized data using scatter plot.
3. Trained Linear Regression model.
4. Predicted prices for new areas.

Model Equation :
price = m × area + b

## Recap Project – City Profit Prediction

Implemented a Linear Regression model to predict business profit based on
city population using a larger real world dataset

The project includes:
- Data visualization
- Best fit regression line
- Predictions on unseen population data

Population is measured in units of 10,000 people and profit in units of $10,000.
