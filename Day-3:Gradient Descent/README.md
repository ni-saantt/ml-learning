I implemented Linear Regression using Gradient Descent from scratch to understand how models actually learn by minimizing error, instead of directly relying on libraries.

To verify the implementation, the results are compared with sklearn’s LinearRegression, and both produce nearly the same coefficients.

The manually implemented gradient descent model closely matches sklearn’s results, confirming a correct understanding of the underlying concepts.
