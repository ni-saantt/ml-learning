I trained a Linear Regression model and learned how to save and load
trained machine learning model so they can be reused without retraining.

Both Pickle and Joblib are used to serialize and restore the model.


Concepts Covered
- Training a Linear Regression model
- Saving a trained model using Pickle
- Saving a trained model using Joblib
- Loading saved models and making predictions



Outcome
The loaded models produce the same coefficients, intercept, and predictions as the original trained model, confirming successful model persistence.
